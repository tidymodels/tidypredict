Title: Run Predictions Inside the Database
Description: It parses a fitted 'R' model object, and returns a formula
    in 'Tidy Eval' code that calculates the predictions.
    It works with several databases back-ends because it leverages 'dplyr'
    and 'dbplyr' for the final 'SQL' translation of the algorithm. It currently
    supports lm(), glm(), randomForest(), ranger(), earth(), xgb.Booster.complete(),
    cubist(), and ctree() models.
